4) CodeBook.docx --> codebook export from NVivo including all codes analyzed deductively and inductively, including number of interviews referencing a code (Files) and the numbe rof total mentions (References)
5) Raw forage fish species distribution model (SDM) probability of occurrence data for the general Monterey Bay Area can be downloaded from https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/FRD_CPS_SDMs.html 
     **Given the local residence of the population, the entire MBNMS was not used for the study spatial extent. Instead, a box encompassing 36O-37O north latitude and 121.5O-123O west longitude was applied.
